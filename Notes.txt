Operators:
operators are different symbol that we can use to perform operation like addition, subtraction we can
 compare things if 2 entities are same or not if a  number is greater than the other number or not.
 there are 3 main types of Operators;
  1. Arithmetic operator
  we use arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations like addition, subtraction etc.
      + => addition
      - => subtraction
      / =>   division
      * => multiplication
      % => modulus, remainder


 2. Relational Operators;
  Relational operator are used tp compare two quantities and entities. for example if something is bigger
  than other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two variable contain same values or not.

     == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get  true otherwise we get false.
     != =>  used to check if two variables don't contain the same value . we get a true if they are not same and if
     they are same then it would be false.
     > =>   used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we got a true.
     < =>   opposite of > used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will
     get a true

   3. logical operators


   important notes
   1  for strings we use equals method instead of == sign because it is a non-primitive data type
   2 if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening part to check the other part.
   ctrl+ alt+l to ix brackets.
